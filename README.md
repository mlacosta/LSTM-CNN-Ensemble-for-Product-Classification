I developed a predictive system for product classification with 1588 different categories. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) combined with Deep Learning I was able to analize over two millons product description from [Mercado Libre](http:///wwww.mercadolibre.com.ar). 

The final model consist in an essemble of diverse kind of Neural Networks, mostly Long Short Term Memory RNN (LSTM) and Convolutional Nets (CNN). Each sub-system was trainned indepently on differents subset of the dataset. Then, to make the final prediction, each output is combined by using weighted sums.
